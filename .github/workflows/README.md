# Iterating your Tinybird data projects with a GitHub repository

Follow the [`Working with version control`](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/guides/working-with-git.html) guide, which explains how to set up your GitLab CI for iterating your Tinybird data project.
A new secret key `TB_ADMIN_TOKEN` will be needed in your repository.

> Visit `Settings >> Secrets and variables >> Actions` section and create a "New repository secret" 

In case a tailored CI/CD solution is needed, take a look at our [ci.yml](https://github.com/tinybirdco/ci/tree/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml) and [cd.yml](https://github.com/tinybirdco/ci/tree/main/.github/workflows/cd.yml) files.

## Snippets
